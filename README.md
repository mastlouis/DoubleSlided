## How to Use the App

Launch the GUI with Eclipse. 
Click a tile adjacent to the blank square to swap it with the blank square.

The Menu Bar at the top has one item: Game.
Game will bring down a sub-menu with three items: Reset, See Solved Puzzle, Change Configuration.

Reset will reset the game to the last requested configuration.
See Solved Puzzle will change the board configuration to a solved puzzle.
Change Configuration will bring down a sub-menu with four items.

The four configurations in the sub-menu are the four board states assigned to the groups of students.

My student ID ends with a 1, so I am assigned configuration 01.

## Notes to the Graders

The game will not allow you to make moves after the board reaches a loss state or the victory state.
